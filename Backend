Backend (Node.js with Express):

// Backend API for serving health record data
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Health record data
const healthRecords = {
  "12345": { name: "patient1", dob: "01/01/2010", /* Additional health record data */ },
  "67890": { name: "patient2", dob: "05/15/2012", /* Additional health record data */ },
  // ...
};

// API endpoint for retrieving health record data
app.get("/api/health-records/:patientId", (req, res) => {
  const { patientId } = req.params;

  if (healthRecords[patientId]) {
    res.json(healthRecords[patientId]);
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ error: "Health record not found" });
  }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 5000");
});
